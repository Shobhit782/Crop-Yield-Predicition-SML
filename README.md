## Overview
The Crop Yield Prediction System is a machine learning project designed to predict the yield of various crops based on historical agricultural data. This system focuses on factors such as average rainfall, pesticide use, average temperature, area of land, and specific crop items, particularly in the context of India.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset named `yield_df.csv`, which contains historical crop yield data for various crops over the World. The dataset includes the following fields:

- Year
- Country
- Crop Item (e.g., wheat, rice, etc.)
- Yield(hg/ha)
- Average Rainfall (mm)
- Pesticide Use (liters per hectare)
- Average Temperature (Â°C)
